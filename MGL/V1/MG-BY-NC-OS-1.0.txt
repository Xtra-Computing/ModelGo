distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations 
or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for 
training the other model.
- "Complementary Materials" means the accompanying source code and scripts

2. License Rights and Redistribution.
By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below) or by using the Licensed 
Materials, You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of 
this ModelGo Attribution-NonCommercial-OpenSource License. If You disagree 
with this License, then no rights are granted to You for the use of the 
Licensed Materials, and You must cease using them immediately.
a. Grant of Patent and Copyright Licenses. Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-
free limited license under patent and copyright claims owned or controlled 
by the Licensor that are embodied in the Model as furnished by the 
Licensor, for the duration of intellectual property rights protection, to 
make, have made, use, Distribute, copy, reproduce, prepare, publicly 
display, publicly perform, create derivative works of, and make 
modifications to the Licensed Materials, in whole or in part, solely for 
Your NonCommercial purposes.
b. Distribution and Redistribution. Every recipient of the Licensed 
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the 
licensed rights under the terms and conditions of this License. You may 
host for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g., software-as-a-service), 
reproduce and Distribute copies of the Licensed Materials or Derivatives of 
the Model thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, provided 
that You meet the following conditions:
i. If You Distribute or make the Licensed Materials, or Derivatives of the 
Model, available to a Third Party, You shall provide a copy of them in 
source code form, or access to that copy from a network server at no 
charge, and a copy of this License to such Third Party. The source code 
form means the preferred form for making modifications and reproducing a 
model. The source code form of a model includes all specific code and 
scripts necessary to train and use this model (excluding Data, system 
library, and any Open Source Software), e.g., all components as included in 
the Definitions of "Model" and "Complementary Materials", if any.
ii. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
that You changed the files and giving a relevant date.
iii. You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution 
notices excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Model, and Derivatives of the Model.
vi. You must retain, in the Derivatives of the Model that You create, all 
copyright, patent, and trademark notices from the Licensed Materials, as 
well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified 
therein as an "Attribution Notice". 
v. Your use of the Licensed Materials must comply with applicable laws and 
regulations (including trade compliance laws and regulations).
vi. You must license Derivatives of the Model You created, as a whole, 
under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This 
License will therefore apply to the whole of the work, and all its parts.
c. The Output You Generate. You will not, and will not permit, assist or 
cause any Third Party to use, modify, copy, reproduce, create derivative 
works of, or Distribute the Output produced by the Licensed Materials, or 
Derivatives of the Model thereof, in whole or in part, for any commercial 
or production purposes. You are accountable for the Output You generate and 
its subsequent uses. If You Distribute the Output created by You with the 
Model (or Derivatives of the Model), You must acknowledge that the Output 
contains AI-generated content created by You using the Model (or 
Derivatives of the Model). No use of the output can contravene any 
provision as stated in the License.
d. Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of the Licensor nor any 
of their trademarks or service marks may be used to endorse or promote 
products derived from this Licensed Materials without express prior 
permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in 
this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, 
patents, trade secrets, or any other intellectual property. No patent 
license is granted to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, or import 
embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in 
this Section. No license is granted to the trademarks of the Licensor, even 
if such marks are included in the Licensed Materials.

3. Disclaimer of Warranty
UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSOR PROVIDES THE LICENSED 
MATERIALS AND ANY OUTPUT AND RESULTS THEREFROM ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, 
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ARE 
SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF USING OR 
REDISTRIBUTING THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND ASSUME ANY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH 
YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIALS AND ANY OUTPUT AND RESULTS.

4. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE 
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCTS LIABILITY) OR OTHERWISE 
FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, 
EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS 
LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES.

5. Termination for Patent Action
This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise 
any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You 
commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against 
Licensor or any Licensee alleging that the Licensed Materials infringe a 
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging 
patent infringement by combinations of the Licensed Materials with other 
software or hardware.

6. Third-Party Materials
The Licensed Materials may contain software or datasets from Third Parties 
(including Open Source Software and free-content works), collectively 
termed "Third-Party Materials", which are subject to the license terms of 
the respective Third-Party licensors. Any interactions, transactions, or 
communications with Third Parties, as well as Your utilization or 
engagement with any Third-Party Materials, are conducted exclusively 
between You and the Third Party. The Licensor neither oversees nor endorses 
and disclaims any representations or warranties regarding Third-Party 
Materials. Your choice to access and use such Third-Party Materials is 
entirely at Your discretion and responsibility.

7. Modification of This License
This License is Copyright © 2024 Moming Duan. Permission is granted to 
copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing 
in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the 
Licensed Materials or to Derivatives of the Model. However, You may modify 
the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate Your modified 
version and apply it to other original works of authorship, provided that 
You furnish a readable notice describing Your modifications to this 
license.

8. Interpretation of Sections 3 and 4.
In the event that the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability, 
as provided above, cannot be granted local legal effect in accordance with 
their terms, these provisions then solely restrict our responsibilities to 
the maximum extent permissible in Your country of residence. Reviewing 
courts shall, in such cases, apply local law that most closely approximates 
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Licensed 
Materials and any Output and results thereof.
