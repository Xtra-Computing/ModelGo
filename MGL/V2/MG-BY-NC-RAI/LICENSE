through distillation methods or synthetic data generation techniques, in order to replicate, 
approximate, or otherwise achieve functional behavior that is similar to the Model.

"Distribution" (or "Distribute") means any transmission, publication, public performance, 
sharing, or other methods of making the Licensed Materials, Derivative Materials and/or Output
