1.	DEFINITIONS

"Complementary Materials" means the source code and scripts used to define, run, load, 
benchmark and/or evaluate the Model, and prepare data for the purpose of training, pretraining, 
fine-tuning and/or evaluation of the Model, and any tutorials, operating manuals, user guides 
and/or documentation that guide users in using, operating, implementing and/or customising 
the Model.

"Derivative Materials" means all improvements, modifications or derivative works to the 
Licensed Material or any part thereof, which are created or developed by You (either by 
Yourself or jointly with other third parties), including any derivative model developed by 
transferring patterns of weights, parameters, activations and/or Output from the Model, such as 
through distillation methods or synthetic data generation techniques, in order to replicate, 
approximate, or otherwise achieve functional behavior that is similar to the Model.

"Distribution" (or "Distribute") means any transmission, publication, public performance, 
sharing, or other methods of making the Licensed Materials, Derivative Materials and/or Output 
available to a third party, including providing the Licensed Materials or any part thereof as a 
hosted service or remotely accessible service, such as API-based access or web access.

"Licensor" means the rights owner that is granting the License.

"Licensed Materials" means the Model and Complementary Materials that are Distributed by 
the Licensor under this License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensed Materials do not 
include any datasets used for pretraining, training, adapting, or evaluating the Model.

"Model" means the machine-learning constructs and/or assemblies licensed by the Licensor 
under this License, including any checkpoints, learned weights, parameters (including optimizer 
states) and the model architecture.

"Output" means any information, data, and/or content, including but not limited to images, text, 
text effects, audio files, and/or video files, generated through operation of the Model, or through 
operation of any new model developed by transferring patterns from the Model.

"You" (or "Your") means you, or any other person or entity you are entering into this license on 
behalf of, provided you have the legal authority to bind such person or entity.
