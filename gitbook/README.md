## About Banner Image

This graph visualizes model reuse behavior (model dependencies) in Hugging Face repositories. Each model is represented as a <mark style="color:purple;">**Purple**</mark> node, while different-colored edges indicate various reuse methods, including <mark style="color:red;">**Finetune**</mark>, <mark style="color:orange;">**Adapter**</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">**Quantization**</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">**Merge**</mark>. From this graph, we can observe complex model dependencies.

Our vision is that as model reuse becomes increasingly prevalent, models published under different  licenses may conflict with one another, leading to more repositories facing **legal non-compliance** issues. One of the missions of the ModelGo License is to promote a more standardized approach to model sharing.
