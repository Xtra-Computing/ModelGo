# ðŸ‘‹ A Standard Way for Model Publishing

## ðŸ“£ Recent Updates 2025.6.26&#x20;

* MG0, MG-BY, and MG-BY-SA have been submitted for [OSI](https://opensource.org/) approval.
* ModelGo Licenses will be presented as an oral talk at [ICML 2025](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/oral/40181).
* ModelGo Licenses are now anchored at [NUS Institute of Data Science](https://ids.nus.edu.sg/modelgo.html)  and [NUS Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://ai.nus.edu.sg/).

## Towards Better Model Sharing

#### **ModelGo licenses** provide CreativeCommons-style licensing solutions to meet your specific needs in publishing AI models. The goal of ModelGo is to facilitate <mark style="color:purple;">managed sharing</mark> of  models while <mark style="color:purple;">protecting Intellectual Property</mark>, striking a balance between openness and control.

## About Banner Image

This graph visualizes model reuse behavior (model dependencies) in Hugging Face repositories. Each model is represented as a <mark style="color:purple;">**Purple**</mark> node, while different-colored edges indicate various reuse methods, including <mark style="color:red;">**Finetune**</mark>, <mark style="color:orange;">**Adapter**</mark>, <mark style="color:green;">**Quantization**</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">**Merge**</mark>. From this graph, we can observe complex model dependencies.

Our vision is that as model reuse becomes increasingly prevalent, models published under different  licenses may conflict with one another, leading to more repositories facing **legal non-compliance** issues. One of the missions of the ModelGo License is to promote a more standardized approach to model sharing.
