# ðŸ“– Understanding ModelGo

## **How Itâ€™s Built**

**ModelGo Licenses V2** is a complete redraft of V1, created with **NUS IDS** and Singapore legal experts, inspired by **OpenRAILs** and **Creative Commons.** V2 resolves V1â€™s potential copyright issues (due to V1 is a remix of existing licenses). We dedicate it to the publicâ€”use ModelGo V2 with confidence.

## Structure

ModelGo licenses consist of eight sections and one or two attachments. Section 2, "License Rights," is the <mark style="color:purple;">primary provision</mark> that grants patent and copyright licenses and states the restrictions of use and distribution.&#x20;

ModelGo licenses include a Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability (Section3, 4), and disclaiming any warranty of Third-Party Materials (Section 6). Additionally, our licenses include terms, as  stated in Section 7, that allow you to modify the license text, provided you furnish a readable notice describing your modifications to this license.&#x20;

The annex, which is separate from the Terms and Conditions of the license, consists of a [Model Sheet](../get-started/how-to-choose.md#with-the-help-of-modelsheet) or, in addition, a list of Use Restrictions for RAI. Your custom restriction terms can be added to the Use Restrictions list. Those changes made to the Model Sheet will not affect the license content.
